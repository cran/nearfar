Description: Near-far matching is a study design technique for preprocessing observational data to mimic a pair-randomized trial. Individuals are matched to be near on measured confounders and far on levels of an instrumental variable. Methods outlined in further detail in Rigdon, Baiocchi, and Basu (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.c05>.
